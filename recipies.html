        <h3>Mushroom Nutritional Information</h3>
        <p>Mushrooms are a healthy vegan option that or low in calories but high in flavour. They should be part of a balanced diet becuase they don't contain as many minerals or vitamins and vegetables would. Below is a table with the typical nutritional values for a store bought white mushroom. Different wild species will vary so use this as a guidline.</p>

        <h2>How to Make Dried Mushrooms</h2>
            <img src="Images/Dried_mushrooms.jpg" alt="dried mushrooms" style="width: 30em; "/>
        <article id="col_detail">
    
        <p>The process of drying mushrooms intensifies individual flavours and scents, meaning each species will have more exaggerated chrarcteristics. Drying mushrooms is great for preserving them for months at a time too and is relatively easy to learn how to do so why not give it a shot</p>
        <p>First wash the mushrooms gently with a damp cloth but don't rinse them as this will damage their delicate tissue. Also check there are no infestations of insects and remove large stalks.</p>
        <p>Then cut the mushrooms into thin slics and place onto a baking sheet lined with several layers of newspaper. Leave in a well ventilated room at 20degress celsius for 2 days. Alternatively, place on a baling tray and put in the oven at 60 degrees celsius for 2 hours if you want a faster method.</p>
        <p>Once the mushrooms aree fully dry transfer them to an air tight jar and store in a cool, dry place. If the mushrooms aren't completely dry, mold can grow on them so be careful. It's as easy as that!</p>
