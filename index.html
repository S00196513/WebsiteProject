    <h2>Frequently asked Questions</h2>
    <section >
        <h3>Is it safe to pick Wild Mushrooms</h3>
        <p>It is only ok to harvest a wild mushroom if you are 100% sure what kind of mushroom they are. It is appropriate to excercise extreme caution and an 'if in doubt, leave it out' policy. However if you know what to look for there is a surprisingly wide array of edible fungi native to Ireland. They offer a nutritious snack or a tasty addition to a main meal. Once picked they must be thoroughly washed because they weren't grown in a controlled environment and there may be harmful pathogens on a perfectly edible wild mushroom. The benefit of eating organic produce like this is that there are no toxic chemicals sprayed on them to keep pests at bay. It should also be noted that you shouldn't touch a mushroom before you have identified it, this is becuase some species are so toxic that even bare skin contact with certain parts of the fungi will result in poisoning. While most of the no go types are easily identifiable becuase they purposely have bright colours to warn would be predators, some look quite similar to edible species. To help lesson confusion we have provided a side by side comparison in our special page on mushroom safety. Check it out <a style="text-decoration: underline; color: blue;">here.</a>   </p>

        <h3>Where is the best place to start hunting?</h3>
        <p>Mushrooms are mostly Saprophtyes, which means they get their energy from dead or decaying organic matter such as dead wood or even dung. That means the best place to look for them would be where those are in large supply, such as woodland or open pastor. If you have access to farmland, you might have encountered edible field mushrooms before and even eaten them. If you don't have the luxury of peering around the cow patties for lunch, your best option is to find your nearest forest park. We are fortunate enough to have many publicly accessible nature reserves and woodland areas in this country so make the most of them.Mushrooms are often found on logs, old or decaying trees and amongst the leaf litter. Unlike plants, they don't photosynthesise, infact  they like shaded areas where the UV rays from the sun can't harm them and the ground still retains its moisture. </p>
