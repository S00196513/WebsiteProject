                Welcome to Fungi Foraging Ireland, where we teach you the rewards and risks of wild mushroom picking. This once niche hobby has experienced a surge of new enthusiasts tired of spending the whole day behind the desk and seeking to reconnect with the natural world. The field may seem daunting to beginners as misjudging an edible species for a poisonous variety might be your last mistake to put it bluntly, however it's the aim of this website to show anyone the necessary information to have a hazard free and exciting foraging experience. We provide information on identification, mushroom anatomy, poisonous species to watch out for, delicious recipes to make the most out of your haul and much more. If you've got a specific uestion you'd like us to address write to us using the <a class="linkStyle" href="contact%20Us.html">contact form</a> and maybe we'll post it in the FAQ's.

    <h2>Frequently asked Questions</h2>
    </section>
    <section >
        <h3>Is it safe to pick wild mushrooms</h3>
        <p>It is only ok to harvest a wild mushroom if you are 100% sure what kind of mushroom they are. It is appropriate to excercise extreme caution and an 'if in doubt, leave it out' policy. However if you know what to look for there is a surprisingly wide array of edible fungi native to Ireland. They offer a nutritious snack or a tasty addition to a main meal. Once picked they must be thoroughly washed because they weren't grown in a controlled environment and there may be harmful pathogens on a perfectly edible wild mushroom. The benefit of eating organic produce like this is that there are no toxic chemicals sprayed on them to keep pests at bay. It should also be noted that you shouldn't touch a mushroom before you have identified it, this is becuase some species are so toxic that even bare skin contact with certain parts of the fungi will result in poisoning. While most of the no go types are easily identifiable becuase they purposely have bright colours to warn would be predators, some look quite similar to edible species. To help lesson confusion we have provided a side by side comparison in our special page on mushroom safety. Check it out <a href="Safety.html" class="linkStyle">here.</a> Below is a helpful video on identification. </p>

        <h3>Where is the best place to start hunting?</h3>
        <p>Mushrooms are mostly Saprophtyes, which means they get their energy from dead or decaying organic matter such as dead wood or even dung. That means the best place to look for them would be where those are in large supply, such as woodland or open pastor. If you have access to farmland, you might have encountered edible field mushrooms before and even eaten them. If you don't have the luxury of peering around the cow patties for lunch, your best option is to find your nearest forest park. We are fortunate enough to have many publicly accessible nature reserves and woodland areas in this country so make the most of them.Mushrooms are often found on logs, old or decaying trees and amongst the leaf litter. Unlike plants, they don't photosynthesise, infact  they like shaded areas where the UV rays from the sun can't harm them and the ground still retains its moisture. Below is a pristine nature reserve that I often use, though you will most likely find one closer and more convenient to get to.</p>

			<h2>Life Cycle of Fungi</h2>
                <p>The edible part of the fungi that you will harvest when it comes in season is actually just one small part of the organism which extends sometimes many metres into the ground. Fungi are typically classified as saprophytes meaning they get their energy from decaying organisms, however in order to colonise new territory they have evolved a system to disperse their spores through the air. The cap, gills and stalk, ie biology of the mushroom we are all familiar with is just their means to do this. Similar to a dandelion which attaches their seeds to parachutes so they are carried on the breeze, except the spores that will grow into new hyphae are so small and light they do not need parachutes to help them fly. Below is a diagram which explains each stage in the lifecycle of the fungus. One of the most interesting facts about fungi is that they reproduce both sexually and asexually. If you would like a more detailed explanation of this process <a class="linkStyle" href="https://www.britannica.com/science/fungus/Life-cycle-of-fungi">here is a very informative article on their biology.</a> </p>

        <ul>
            <li><h5>Spores;</h5><p>Haploid cells that germinate on the basis of sufficient access to nutrients, moisture and heat.</p></li>
            <li><h5>Hyphae;</h5><p>Grow from the spores. Mating occurs between hyphae from diferent spores. This is sexual reproduction to ensure genetic diversity. The new cells contain DNA from both parent spores. They are diploid in nature because they conatin two complete set of chromosomes. The new mycelium grows until the time when it will release it's own spores. </p></li>
            <li><h5>sporangia;</h5> <p>Appear which are growth capsules for the reproductive organ of the fungi.The mushroom grows inside the sporangiophores until it burts out of the capsule and the soil</p></li>
            <li><h5>Mushroom;</h5><p>The mushroom continues to grow outside of the ground and fans out it's gills to release new spores into the environment, continuing the life cycle of the funngi.</p></li>
