        <h2>Don't Be Fooled!</h2>
        <p>Every year in ireland a shockingly high number of people are poisoned due to ingesting or skin contact of poisonous mushrooms. While most cause digestive irritation some are fatal and even experienced foragers can get it wrong sometimes so it really pays to know some of the common and easily recognisable species to avoid. Always seek immediate medical help if you feel ill after eating wild mushrooms. You should also wear gloves when handling mushrooms and don't touvh your face or eyes before washing your hands.</p>

        <img src="Images/fly-agaric-2751467_1280.jpg" alt="fly agaric" class="image_size"/>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>This is most peoples idea of a poinous mushroom probably because of it's unmistakable red cap with white flecks. It's evolved like this specifically to warn predators not to eat it although not all species of poisonous mushrooms have these warning signs. This particluar mushroom has been associated with myths and magic for centuries.</p>
        <h4>Season:</h4>
        <p>summer to autumn</p>
        <h4>Habitat:</h4>
        <p>birch forests</p>
        <h4>Symptoms:</h4>
        <p>It attacks the central nervous system causing halucinations and unpleasant intoxication which can up to 2 days to recover from but even then the poison stays in your months</p>

        <h3>Death Cap</h3>
        <img src="Images/death%20cap.jpg" alt="death cap" class="image_size"/>
        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>One of the most fatal kinds that accounts for most of the fatal cases that occur each year it doesn't look particularily menacing with it's pretty, understated, pale cap 3-15cm across. It can offer appear greenish and the stalk is off-wite.This mushroom also has a sweet smell if you dare to get that close to it. The volval cap is also quite pronounced</p>
        <h4>Season:</h4>
           <p>summer to autumn</p>
        <h4>Habitat:</h4>
           <p>mixed deciduous amd coniferous woodland </p>
        <h4>Symptoms:</h4>
           <p>takes 10 to 24 hours for symptoms to appear, and the poison attacks the liver and kidneys causing acute organ failure. The first signs are diarrhoea and abdominal pain. If you can get to a hospital in time and they know you ingested a death cap you can be given carbo column dialysis which has saved a number of lives in recent years. The scariest part is that symptoms can seem to eleviate for a time but death from organ failure will occur suddenly afterwards if nothing is urgently done.</p>
